# Configuration

- By default the plugin is configured to run provided AccDynLeaderboard dash but you can add and configure more 
  leaderboards under "Dynamic leaderboards" tab. 
  Further explanation of each option is explained directly in the setting pages and by the tooltips of settings. 
  All available properties are also listed on [properties page](../reference/properties.md).

- If you add multiple dynamic leaderboards, you need to add mappings for each leaderboard. 
  It can be the same button for all of them. 

- Settings under "General settings" are common to all leaderboards.

- ***IMPORTANT*: For the settings changes to take effect you need to restart SimHub.**
